# DOACs-AF-Economic-model
# R code for cost-effectiveness model evaluating directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation.
# To use, move the .R files to a "code" directory and that data files to a "data" directory. Everything can then be run from NOAC.AF.model.main.3.R

# This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), NIHR Senior Investigator award NF-SI-0611-10168.
# Support for R in CEA provided by MRC Hubs for Trials Methodology Research ConDuCT-II (Collaboration and innovation in Difficult and Complex randomised controlled Trials In Invasive procedures) hub
